# Minimizing-the-cost-of-power-consumption-in-the-data-center
We will leverage an AI silution based on Deep Q-learning to minimize energy consumption of a single server, and thanks to the object oriented structure of our implementation, our AI model will be applicable to any server of a same data center, thus minimizing the costs of the whole data center. The solution can be applied and used in the problems of cost minimization for any business related to data center. So minimizing the energy consumstion in the data center will minimize the cost. Thus, the tech companies have tremendous cost coming from their data center, and these costs come directly from the energy consumption and the different services.This is a special case study but the whole framework that were going to build is totally adaptable to any other businesses. 
To solve this issue we gonna use Deep Q_Learning as an AI solution. Deep Q-Learning is the model that build by the top of AI research lab which is deep mind. Thus, we will give the general framework of how to build an AI with deep Q_Learning and to accomplish a certain goal which is here to minimize the costs.So if you want to apply what we're going to do to your business or your work, you will only have to change a few parameters and a few lines of code to defined differently the different components of the environment such as how you define the reward.
